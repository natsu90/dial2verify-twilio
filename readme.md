## Dial2Verify Twilio

Phone verification at no cost!

Well, not really. You still have to pay Twilio for the phone numbers ($1 per month each).

### Warning

A lot of peoples have pointed out that phone number can be spoofed, so this can't be used as a form of secure authentication. More discussions here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11652454

### Idea

I stumbled this [page](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/reject) in Twilio API documentation while working on some other idea.

> The `<Reject>` verb rejects an incoming call to your Twilio number without billing you. This is very useful for blocking unwanted calls.

Noted that Twilio will trigger webhook for any incoming phone call if you set the **Status Callback URL**. So I thought this can be used for phone verification, with no additional cost.

### Missed Call Verification

1. User send phone number from a web form
2. We will return a phone number for user to dial
3. User have to dial the number within 90 seconds, otherwise verification will expired
